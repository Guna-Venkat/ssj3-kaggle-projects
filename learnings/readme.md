# 📘 ML & DL Learnings Archive

Welcome to the **learnings/** folder of the `SSJ3-Kaggle-Projects` repository. This section serves as a growing **knowledge base** where I document common workflows, reusable templates, and detailed notes from my journey across **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)** competitions.

---

## 📂 Purpose

This folder is meant to help:

- Avoid repetition across projects like **Titanic**, **House Prices**, and future Kaggle challenges.
- Collect and reuse **common logic**: preprocessing, evaluation metrics, modeling strategies, etc.
- Track personal **learnings**, tricks, and edge cases encountered during hands-on experimentation.

## 🧱 Current Topics

| 📁 File                          | 🔍 Description |
|----------------------------------|----------------|
| `regression-vs-classification.md` | Key differences in approach, metrics, and modeling techniques |
| `metrics-comparison.md`          | Evaluation metrics for regression and classification problems |
| `common-workflow.md`             | Step-by-step template for any tabular Kaggle competition |
| `feature-engineering.md`         | Tricks and logic for meaningful feature creation |
| `handling-missing-values.md`     | Strategies for imputing or transforming nulls in real-world data |

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

As I explore more domains, this folder will include:

### 🧠 Deep Learning
- CNNs for image problems
- RNNs and Transformers
- Style Transfer experiments
- Model checkpoints and training logs

### ✍️ NLP & LLMs
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Fine-tuning BERT/LLMs
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Named Entity Recognition (NER), summarization, and classification tasks

### ⚙️ Tooling & MLOps
- Model tracking (MLflow)
- Experiment automation
- Efficient training tips (mixed precision, data loaders)

## 🧪 Philosophy

This is more than a folder—it's a **learning lab**. Each `.md` file represents hours of debugging, testing, tuning, and building intuition through projects. These notes help reinforce concepts and are **100% reproducible** across projects.

---

## 🧠 Tip for Readers

You can clone this structure and reuse it for your own ML journey. As your projects grow, this structure will help you scale knowledge, reuse code, and benchmark results more systematically.
